                <p>By Olivia Wilson</p>
                <p>The life that Kim and Krickitt Carpenter knew changed completely on November 24, 1993, two months after their wedding, when the back of their car was hit by a speeding pickup truck. A serious head injury left Krickitt in a coma for several weeks. When she finally woke up, part of her memory was compromised and she couldn't remember her husband. She had no idea who he was. Essentially, the "Krickitt" Kim had married died in the accident, and at that moment he needed to win back the woman he loved.</p>
